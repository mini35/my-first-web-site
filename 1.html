    <p style="margin-top:45px;">Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the dominant markup language developed for
        displaying web pages. HTML also provides a way to create structured documents with links, citations, and other
        items, as well as representing structural semantics for body text, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists. It
        is written in the form of HTML elements with "tags" enclosed in angle brackets. HTML may contain or invoke
        scripts, such as JavaScript, which affect the behavior of HTML processing devices, such as web browsers, and
        CSS, which define the appearance and layout of body and other items. The W3C, co-director of the HTML and CSS
        standards, recommends the use of CSS for clear and expressive markup.</p>
