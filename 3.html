            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript (English: JavaScript) is an object-based script programming language. This language is mainly
                used
                within the web browser and has the ability to access built-in objects of other applications. It is also
                used for
                server programming as well as for runtime environments such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally
                developed by
                Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation, first under the name Mocha and later under the name
                LiveScript, and eventually became JavaScript. Although JavaScript has similar syntax with Sun
                Microsystems'
                Java, this is actually because both languages ​​are based on the basic syntax of the C language, and
                Java and
                JavaScript are not directly related. Aside from the name and syntax, it has more similarities to Self
                and Scheme
                than to Java. JavaScript is recognized as the language that best implements the standard specifications
                of
                ECMAScript. Up to ECMAScript 5 (ES5), it was basically supported by most browsers, but from ECMAScript 6
                onward,
                it is compiled with a transpiler for browser compatibility.</p>
