    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript (English: JavaScript) is an object-based script programming language. This language is mainly used
        within the web browser and has the ability to access built-in objects of other applications. It is also used for
        server programming as well as for runtime environments such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by
        Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation, first under the name Mocha and later under the name
        LiveScript, and eventually became JavaScript. Although JavaScript has similar syntax with Sun Microsystems'
        Java, this is actually because both languages ​​are based on the basic syntax of the C language, and Java and
        JavaScript are not directly related. Aside from the name and syntax, it has more similarities to Self and Scheme
        than to Java. JavaScript is recognized as the language that best implements the standard specifications of
        ECMAScript. Up to ECMAScript 5 (ES5), it was basically supported by most browsers, but from ECMAScript 6 onward,
        it is compiled with a transpiler for browser compatibility.</p>
